# Dynamic Agent Detection System

## Overview
The system now uses **intelligent content analysis** instead of static keyword matching to detect user intent and generate appropriate agents.

## How It Works

### 🧠 **LLM-Powered Detection**
- **No Static Keywords**: Removed hardcoded keyword lists
- **Context Understanding**: Analyzes the full meaning and intent of messages
- **Multilingual Support**: Works with any language naturally
- **Intent Recognition**: Understands what users want to accomplish, not just what words they use

### 🎯 **Dynamic Agent Generation**

#### Primary Agent Detection
The system analyzes the user's message to understand their **main intent**:

```
User: "البريد الإلكتروني - أرسل التقرير"
→ LLM understands: User's primary intent is to send email
→ Creates: mailer agent
```

```
User: "I need to share this analysis with my team"
→ LLM understands: User wants to share/communicate results
→ Creates: mailer agent
```

```
User: "Let John know about these findings"
→ LLM understands: User wants to notify someone
→ Creates: mailer agent
```

#### Secondary Agent Detection
The system also detects **additional tasks** mentioned in the message:

```
User: "Analyze this report and send it to the manager"
→ Primary: analyzer (main task)
→ Additional: mailer (secondary task)
→ Workflow: analyzer → mailer
```

## Examples of Dynamic Detection

### ✅ **Email Intent Detection**
The system recognizes email intent from various expressions:

| User Message | Detected Intent | Agents Created |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| "البريد الإلكتروني" | Send email | mailer |
| "share with the team" | Send/share results | mailer |
| "let Sarah know" | Notify someone | mailer |
| "distribute the findings" | Share information | mailer |
| "forward to client" | Send to someone | mailer |
| "notify the manager" | Inform someone | mailer |

### 🔗 **Multi-Agent Workflows**
The system detects complex workflows:

| User Message | Primary Agent | Additional Agents | Workflow |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| "Analyze this and email results" | analyzer | mailer | analyze → email |
| "Calculate ROI and share findings" | mathematical | mailer | calculate → email |
| "Summarize doc and send to team" | summarizer | mailer | summarize → email |
| "Review report and notify John" | analyzer | mailer | analyze → notify |

### 🌍 **Multilingual Understanding**
Works naturally with any language:

| Language | Message | Detection |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Arabic | "أرسل هذا التقرير إلى المدير" | mailer |
| Spanish | "comparte esto con el equipo" | mailer |
| French | "envoie ça à Marie" | mailer |
| German | "teile das mit dem Team" | mailer |
| English | "send this to the client" | mailer |

## Benefits

### 🎯 **Intelligent Understanding**
- Understands **intent**, not just words
- Recognizes **implied actions** and **workflows**
- Adapts to **natural language** variations
- Works with **any language** automatically

### 🚀 **Dynamic Adaptation**
- No need to update keyword lists
- Automatically handles new ways of expressing intent
- Learns from context and meaning
- Scales to new languages and expressions

### ⚡ **Better User Experience**
- Users can express requests naturally
- No need to use specific keywords
- System understands complex multi-step requests
- Works intuitively across languages

## Technical Implementation

### LLM Prompts
The system uses sophisticated prompts that:
1. **Analyze intent** rather than match keywords
2. **Understand context** and workflow implications
3. **Recognize communication patterns** across languages
4. **Detect secondary tasks** and follow-up actions

### Agent Normalization
All agent types are normalized to English internally:
- "البريد الإلكتروني" → "mailer"
- "تحليل" → "analyzer"
- "ملخص" → "summarizer"

This ensures consistent tool assignment and workflow execution.

## Result
The system now **intelligently understands** what users want to accomplish and **dynamically creates** the appropriate agents to fulfill their requests, regardless of how they express their intent or what language they use.
